#![allow(clippy::needless_doctest_main)]
//! This crate provides the [`target`]  and [`multiversion`] attributes for implementing
//! function multiversioning.
//!
//! Many CPU architectures have a variety of instruction set extensions that provide additional
//! functionality. Common examples are single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) extensions such as
//! SSE and AVX on x86/x86-64 and NEON on ARM/AArch64. When available, these extended features can
//! provide significant speed improvements to some functions. These optional features cannot be
//! haphazardly compiled into programsâ€“executing an unsupported instruction will result in a
//! crash.
//!
//! **Function multiversioning** is the practice of compiling multiple versions of a function
//! with various features enabled and safely detecting which version to use at runtime.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//! There is one cargo feature, `std`, enabled by default.  When enabled, [`multiversion`] will
//! use CPU feature detection at runtime to dispatch the appropriate function. Disabling this
//! feature will only allow compile-time function dispatch using `#[cfg(target_feature)]` and can
//! be used in `#[no_std]` crates.
//!
//! # Capabilities
//! The intention of this crate is to allow nearly any function to be multiversioned.
//! The following cases are not supported:
//! * trait methods
//! * `impl Trait` return types (arguments are fine)
//!
//! If any other functions do not work please file an issue on GitHub.
//!
//! The [`multiversion`] macro produces additional functions adjacent to the tagged function which
//! do not correspond to a trait member.  If you would like to multiversion a trait method, instead
//! try multiversioning a free function or struct method and calling it from the trait method.
//!
//! # Target specification strings
//! Targets for the [`target`] and [`multiversion`] attributes are specified as a combination of
//! architecture (as specified in the [`target_arch`] attribute) and feature (as specified in the
//! [`target_feature`] attribute). A target can be specified as:
//! * `"arch"`
//! * `"arch+feature"`
//! * `"arch+feature1+feature2"`
//!
//! The following are some valid target specification strings:
//! * `"x86"` (matches the `"x86"` architecture)
//! * `"x86_64+avx+avx2"` (matches the `"x86_64"` architecture with the `"avx"` and `"avx2"`
//! features)
//! * `"arm+neon"` (matches the `arm` architecture with the `"neon"` feature
//!
//! # Example
//! The following example is a good candidate for optimization with SIMD.  The function `square`
//! optionally uses the AVX instruction set extension on x86 or x86-64.  The SSE instruction set
//! extension is part of x86-64, but is optional on x86 so the square function optionally detects
//! that as well.  This is automatically implemented by the [`multiversion`] attribute.
//!
//! The following works by compiling multiple *clones* of the function with various features enabled
//! and detecting which to use at runtime. If none of the targets match the current CPU (e.g. an older
//! x86-64 CPU, or another architecture such as ARM), a clone without any features enabled is used.
//! ```
//! use multiversion::multiversion;
//!
//! #[multiversion(clones("x86_64+avx", "x86+sse"))]
//! fn square(x: &mut [f32]) {
//!     for v in x {
//!         *v *= *v;
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Provides function multiversioning.
///
/// Options:
/// * `clones` or `versions`
///   * `clones` takes a list of targets, such as `clones("x86_64+avx2", "x86_64+sse4.1")`.
///   * `versions` takes a list of complete target specifications, either in the form of `clone =
///   "x86_64+avx"` or `alternative(target = "x86_64+avx", fn = "foo::bar", unsafe = false)`
///     * If target of the alternative function matches, it's called instead of the tagged
///     function.
///     * `target`: The target specification required by this alternative function version.
///     * `fn`: The alternative function.
///     * `unsafe`: Defaults to `false`.  If `true`, indicates an `unsafe` alternative function can
///       be called on the specified target safely and that the safety contract is fulfilled.  If
///       the function is unsafe for any other reason, remember to mark the tagged function `unsafe`
///       and do not set this to true.
///   * Functions version priority is first to last.  The first matching target is used.
/// * `crate_path`
///   * Specifies the location of the multiversion crate (useful for re-exporting).
/// * `associated_fn`
///   * Indicates whether or not this function is an associated function.  If the first argument is
///   a form of `self`, this defaults to `true`, otherwise defaults to `false`.
/// * `dispatcher`
///   * Selects the preferred dispatcher. Defaults to `default`.
///     * `default`: If the `std` feature is enabled, uses either `direct` or `indirect`,
///       attempting to choose the fastest choice.  If the `std` feature is not enabled, uses `static`.
///     * `static`: Detects features at compile time from the enabled target features.
///     * `direct`: Detects features at runtime, and dispatches with direct function calls.
///     * `indirect`: Detect features at runtime, and dispatches with an indirect function call.
///       Cannot be used for generic functions, associated functions, `async` functions, or
///       functions that take or return an `impl Trait`.
///
/// # Examples
/// ## Function cloning
/// The following compiles `square` three times, once for each target and once for the generic
/// target.  Calling `square` selects the appropriate version at runtime.
/// ```
/// use multiversion::multiversion;
///
/// #[multiversion(versions(clone = "x86_64+avx", clone = "x86+sse"))]
/// fn square(x: &mut [f32]) {
///     for v in x {
///         *v *= *v
///     }
/// }
/// ```
/// or more simply:
/// ```
/// use multiversion::multiversion;
///
/// #[multiversion(clones("x86_64+avx", "x86+sse"))]
/// fn square(x: &mut [f32]) {
///     for v in x {
///         *v *= *v
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Implementation details
/// The function version dispatcher performs function selection on the first invocation.
/// This is implemented with a static atomic variable containing the selected function.
///
/// This implementation has a few benefits:
/// * The function selector is typically only invoked once.  Subsequent calls are reduced to an
/// atomic load.
/// * If called in multiple threads, there is no contention.  Both threads may perform feature
/// detection, but the atomic ensures these are synchronized correctly.
/// * The selected function is represented by an integer, rather than a function pointer.  This
/// allows caching function selection in generic and `async` functions.  This also allows the
/// function calls to be direct, rather than indirect, improving performance in the presence of
/// indirect branch exploit mitigations such as retpolines.

pub use multiversion_macros::multiversion;

/// Provides a less verbose equivalent to the `target_arch` and `target_feature` attributes.
///
/// A function tagged with `#[target("[x86|x86_64]+avx+avx2")]`, for example, is equivalent to a
/// function tagged with each of:
/// * `#[target_arch(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))]`
/// * `#[target_feature(enable = "avx")]`
/// * `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]`
///
/// The [`target`] attribute is intended to be used in tandem with the [`multiversion`] attribute
/// to produce hand-written multiversioned functions.
///
/// # Helper attributes
/// * `#[safe_inner]`
///   * Indicates that the inner contents of the function are safe and requires the use of `unsafe`
///     blocks to call `unsafe` functions.
